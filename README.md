# Amaturufu - A Rwandan Card Game

- Amaturufu is played with 36 cards (3, 4, 5, 6, Q, J, K, 7, and A of each suit). The cards are ranked from lowest to highest as follows: 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < Q < J < K < 7 < A. 

- The aim of the game is to collect as many high-value cards as possible. The cards have different values for scoring: Q = 2 points, J = 3 points, K = 4 points, 7 = 10 points, A = 11 points. The cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 are worth zero points and are called blanks.

- One suit is chosen as the trump suit before the game begins. The trump suit beats any other suit in a play. For example, if the trump suit is hearts and one player plays a heart and the other player plays a spade, the player with the heart wins the play and takes both cards.

- If both players play cards of the same suit (either trump or non-trump), the player with the higher-ranked card wins the play and takes both cards. For example, if both players play clubs and one player plays a Q and the other player plays a J, the player with the Q wins the play and takes both cards.

- If both players play cards of different suits and neither of them is trump, the player who played the first card (the bottom card) wins the play and takes both cards. For example, if one player plays a diamond and the other player plays a club, and neither of them is trump, the player who played the diamond wins the play and takes both cards.

- The game ends when all 36 cards have been played and collected by the players. Each player counts the points of the cards they have collected. The player with the most points wins the game. If both players have the same number of points, the game is a tie.
